\subsection{Development Data Preparation}

In the following, the data preparation techniques applied to the development dataset are explained in detail.

\subsubsection{Data Preprocessing}
\label{subsubsec:img_preprocess_dev}

% Preprocessing of development dataset

% TODO -> wo "as described previously" -> näher beschreiben

Individual DAT-SPECT images were stereotactically normalized to the anatomical space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 
using the Normalize tool of the Statistical Parametric Mapping software package (version SPM12) and a set of custom DAT-SPECT templates 
representative of normal and different levels of Parkinson-typical reduction of striatal uptake as target [73]. 
The voxel size of the stereotactically normalized images was 2x2x2 mm$^{3}$. 
Intensity normalization was achieved by voxelwise scaling to the individual 75th percentile of the voxel intensity in a reference region 
comprising the whole brain without striata, thalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, and ventricles [74]. 
The resulting images are distribution volume (DVR) images. 
A 2-dimensional transversal DVR slab of 12mm thickness and 91x109 pixels with 2 mm edge length was obtained by averaging 6 transversal slices through the striatum [75]. 

\subsubsection{Data Augmentation}
\label{subsec:augment}

Data augmentation was applied to the development dataset to increase the heterogeneity of the data.
To enhance robustness across various attenuation correction and scatter correction methods, 
each image was generated both with and without applying attenuation and scatter corrections.
Also 3D-smoothing was employed for augmentation using an isotropic Gaussian kernel with various 
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) values (FWHM = 10, 12, 14, 16, 18mm).
Thereby an augmented dataset of 20,880 images in total was constructed based on 1,740 cases.
An example of two cases augmented using the described techniques is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:dev_dataset}.

    a healthy case (above) and a PD case with reduced availability of DAT in the striatum (below).}

  \end{figure} 

\subsubsection{Dataset Splitting}
\label{subsec:split}

% How was development dataset split
The augmented development dataset was split into three subsets: train set (60\%), validation set (20\%) 
and test set (20\%).
While splitting the data it was ensured that the augmented images belonging to a concrete patient were put 
only into one subset.
Thereby inter-subset data leakage was prohibited.
Ten different random splits were created to train and test each of the methods.

\subsection{Univariate benchmark: Specific Binding Ratio}
\label{subsec:sbr}

% TODO -> wo "as described previously" -> näher beschreiben

The unilateral [$^{123}$I]FP-CIT specific binding ratio (SBR) was used as a benchmark classification method.
Here, the SBR in left and right putamen was obtained by hottest voxels (HV) analysis of the stereotactically normalized 
DVR image using large unilateral putamen masks predefined in MNI space [46].
It can be calculated as 

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sbr}
  \text{HV-SBR}_{unilateral} = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k} \hat{I}_{k, ROI} \;,
\end{equation}

where $\hat{I}_{k, ROI}$ are the \textit{normalized} voxel intensities of the $K$-hottest voxels of the unilateral ROI.
The voxel intensities of the hottest voxels are normalized to the 75th percentile of the voxel intensities 
in the reference region associated with non-specific binding [46].
The minimum of the HV-SBR values from the left and right hemispheres was used for the analysis.
An in-depth elaboration on SBR analysis can be found in [46].

The SBR-based classifier was obtained as follows.
First the SBR was calculated for each case in the training set.
Then the optimal cutoff on the SBR was determined using ROC analysis and the Youden criterion~\citep{Youden1950}.
The optimal cutoff was then used as the decision boundary between normal cases (NC) and Parkinson's disease (PD) 
for the SBR of the test set cases.
